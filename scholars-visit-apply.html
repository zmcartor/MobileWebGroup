									<h1>FAQ</h1>
									<br />
										<h2>What is the difference between the Honors Program and the Scholars Program?</h2>
										<p>The University Honors Program and the Ohio State Scholars Program are specialized programs for high ability students interested in joining academically stimulating, close-knit communities within the larger Ohio State community. Both programs are open to students in any of Ohio State’s 170+ majors. The basic difference between the two programs is that Honors is a curricular program (i.e., the focus is on activities occurring in the classroom) and Scholars is a co-curricular program (i.e., the focus is on activities occurring outside of the classroom).</p>
										<h2>Can I be in both the Honors Program and the Scholars Program?</h2>
										<p>You cannot initially enroll in both programs as an incoming freshman. As an incoming first year student, you submit an application for admission that allows you to be considered for the Honors Program and all 14 Scholars Programs. Please note that you can only join the Scholars Program as an incoming freshman. However, the Honors Program accepts transfer students as well as currently enrolled Ohio State students. Therefore, Scholars students who meet Honors Program criteria after being on campus for at least 1 semester may apply to the Honors Program directly through their college of enrollment.</p>
										<h2>How are the Scholars Programs organized?</h2>
										<p>The Ohio State Scholars Program is comprised of <a href="http://honors-scholars.osu.edu/scholars/programs.aspx">14 theme-based programs</a>. Each Scholars Program has at least one professional staff person who coordinates the activities and events designed to enhance each Scholars student’s learning and development in that particular program area.</p>
										<h2>How do I apply to the Scholars Program?</h2>
										<p>Please <a href="http://hsapp.osu.edu/">click here</a> to submit your online application to the Ohio State Scholars Program and the University Honors Program.</p>
										<h2>When is the application deadline?</h2>
										<p>Please click here to submit your online application to the Ohio State Scholars Program and the University Honors Program.</p>
										<h2>Why doesn’t the online application ask for my test scores, class rank or GPA?</h2>
										<p>The online application does not ask for test scores, class rank, or GPA because we access that information from your official high school transcript and test scores that you submit to the university when you apply for admission.</p>
										<h2>Is there a minimum test score or class rank/GPA to apply?</h2>
										<p>There is no minimum set of requirements to be considered for the Scholars Program. All interested students are encouraged to apply. Please note that your application will not advance in the review process until you are admitted to the Columbus campus.</p>
										<h2>How will I know if you have received my application?</h2>
										<p>Once we receive your application, we will acknowledge receipt via email to the address that you provide in your application. You can always contact our office if you want to make sure that we have your application. You can <a href="mailto:honors-scholars@osu.edu">email us</a> or you can call us at 614.292.3135. The Center’s hours during the academic year are as follows: </p>
											<ul>
												<li>Monday through Thursday: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</li>
												<li>Friday: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</li>
											</ul>
										<h2>When will I know whether I&rsquo;ve been accepted to one of the programs?</h2>
										<p>Students who meet the December 15th priority application deadline will receive their decision in late January. Students who apply after December 15th but by the February 15th final deadline will receive their decision in late March.</p>
										<h2>How much does it cost to go to Ohio State and are there extra fees to be in the Honors Program or the Scholars Programs?</h2>
										<p>There are no additional fees associated with being in the Honors Program or one of the Scholars Programs. Please visit <a href="http://undergrad.osu.edu/costs.html">http://undergrad.osu.edu/costs.html</a> to learn more about the cost of attending Ohio State.</p>
										<h2>What are the requirements to stay in the Scholars Program?</h2>
										<p>In order to remain in good standing in the Scholars Program, you must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 and be an active participant in your particular Scholars Program (e.g., Arts Scholars, Health Sciences Scholars, etc.) by meeting the requirements set by your program coordinator.</p>
										<h2>Do I have to live in a Scholars residence hall if I am admitted to the Scholars Program?</h2>
										<p>Yes, you have to live in the residence hall that is specific to your Scholars Program during your first year as a Scholar student unless you are commuting to campus from home.</p>
										<h2>When will I get information about campus housing, selecting my residence hall, and learning who my roommate is?</h2>
										<p>Housing contracts are sent via email from the Housing Office based upon when students pay their $100 acceptance fee to Ohio State. Students may receive housing contracts as early as March. The contract asks students to indicate the area of campus in which they would prefer to live. Students can also preference a space in an Honors residence hall or note their interest in living with someone that they already know. Actual housing assignments that specify residence hall, room number, and roommate(s) are sent to students’ Ohio State email address in July.</p>
										<h2>When will I receive information about orientation?</h2>
										<p>Orientation information is mailed to students from the Orientation Office based upon when students pay their $100 acceptance fee to Ohio State. Students begin receiving information packets in early spring that will allow them to schedule orientation dates.</p>
										<h2>Who do I call if I want information about...</h2>
