										<p>
											The Health Sciences Scholars (HSS) Program introduces students to
											the wide variety of academic programs and career opportunities in health sciences
											and health care. Health Sciences Scholars might be interested in study and careers
											in the allied medical professions (athletic training; health information management
											and systems; health sciences; medical dietetics; physical, occupational, and respiratory
											therapy; or medical and radiologic technology), dental hygiene, dentistry, medicine,
											nursing, optometry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Some Scholars may be committed to a particular career or course of
												study, while others may wish to explore the many exciting possibilities available
												in the health sciences. The Health Sciences Scholars Program enables serious students
												to pursue a thoughtfully planned co-curricular program that will help to prepare
												them for success in these fields.
												<br />
												<br />

									<h1>FAQ</h1>
									<div class="ten columns alpha">
										<p>
										   <b>
											When did the Health Sciences Scholars (HSS) Program begin?</b></p>
										<p>
											The HSS Program is beginning its 11th year. It began in the 
											autumn quarter of 2000 with an entering class of 211 students.
										</p>
										<b>
											Why was the Health Sciences Scholars (HSS) Program created?</b>
										<p>
											The HSS Program was created because a need existed to better 
											serve students interested in the Health Sciences. One of the main goals of HSS 
											is to help students explore the options both within and outside of the health 
											sciences. In this competitive field, students often do not get their first 
											choice of programs and have a need for multiple options; HSS will help you to 
											create back up plans.</p>
										<b>
											How long does the Health Sciences Scholars (HSS) Program last?</b>
										<p>
											HSS is a two-year Scholars Program. Juniors and seniors who 
											“graduate” from the program still enjoy all of the programs benefits, but do not 
											have the same obligations as first and second year students in terms of 
											involvement and community service. Upperclassmen typically take on more 
											leadership roles in the program by serving as Buckeye Buddies to HSS first year students, 
											participating on the HSS Leadership Council, and by assisting with recruitment 
											events.
										</p>
										<b>
											How many students does the Health Sciences Scholars Program 
											enroll each year?</b>
										<p>
											HSS is currently the largest Scholars Program. Each year, the 
											program receives many more applications than it can accommodate. There are 152 students enrolled in the 2011 HSS First Year Cohort.
										</p>
										<b>
										   Do I have to be a certain major to be in HSS?</b>
										<p>
										   No, as long as you have an interest in a career in the wide world of health sciences. 
											Whether your interests fall at the undergraduate level (ex: nursing, dental hygiene, respiratory therapy, etc.) or 
											at the professional level (ex: medicine, optometry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, etc.),  you can major in ANYTHING. 
											For example, there is no “prescribed” major for medical school. You can major in music, athletic training, architecture, medical technology, English, 
											biology, or any of the other 180 majors at Ohio State. This is one of the biggest misconceptions regarding pre-professional students!! 
											Your major should be something you truly enjoy and possibly something that you envision as your back up plan should you choose not to pursue graduate/professional school.
										</p>
										<b>
										   What health sciences majors (undergraduate) are offered at Ohio State?</b>
										<p>
											There are many undergraduate programs at The Ohio State University
												in the health sciences. These include, but are not limited to: Athletic Training,
												Circulation Technology, Dental Hygiene, Health Information Management Systems, Health
												Sciences, Human Nutrition and Food Management, Medical Dietetics,
												Medical Technology, Nursing, BSPS in Pharmacy, Radiologic Technology, Respiratory
												Therapy, and Speech and Hearing Science. At Ohio State there are no “pre” majors
												such as pre-med or pre-dentistry. Instead, there is a curriculum that you follow
												of about 15 courses that you would take to meet the medical or health-related professional school requirements,
												but you can build those into any OSU major.
										</p>
										<b>
											What Health Sciences professional programs (graduate level) are offered
												at Ohio State?</b>
										<p>
										   There are many graduate level programs at The Ohio State University in the health sciences. These include, but are not limited to: Dentistry, Health Services Management and Policy, Integrated Biomedical Science, Medicine, Nursing (Advanced/Specialized), Speech Pathology/Audiology, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy (PharmD), Physical Therapy, Public Health, and Veterinary Medicine. 
										</p>
										<b>
										   Do I have to live in a particular residence hall if I am in HSS?
										</b>
										<p>
											If you are in the Health Sciences Scholars Program (and will not be a student commuting from home) you will live with other HSS students in the newly renovated Park-Stradley Hall (beginning autumn 2012) located on the south end of campus. Most first year students will be staying in double rooms, equipped with a micro-fridge, loft-able beds, moveable furniture and will share corridor bathrooms. The HSS Program also accepts commuter students who are given access to the residence hall and included in all events.
										</p>
										<b>
											Do I have to live on campus my second year?</b>
										<p>
											No. Non-commuting HSS students are only required to 
											live on campus their first year. However, Canfield contains four 
											single-person rooms.
										</p>
										<b>
											Would I take different classes being in HSS than being just a regular
												pre-med (or whatever) student?</b>
										<p>
											Yes and no. Being in HSS does not change the curriculum of your major
												or pre-professional program. The Scholars Programs are mainly co-curricular programs
												in nature. However, we do “cluster” some sections of classes that you would
												be taking anyway. That means that in those classes, you would be with only other
												HSS or Scholars students. The curriculum in clustered courses does not change. By
												clustering some courses we make it easier to form study groups and it is also nice
												to be in classes with your peers who live in Canfield. 
										</p>
										<b>
											Is my Program Coordinator my Academic Advisor?</b>
										<p>
											No. Each student will have both a college and a major 
											advisor. Those heading into professional areas will also have an advisor 
											in those areas. Your coordinator will keep weekly office hours in both 
											their main office and in Canfield Hall to address general questions and 
											concerns. Students should seek specific curricular advice from their 
											academic advisors.
