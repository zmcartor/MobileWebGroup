												<p>Architecture Scholars examine the world with a critical 
												eye though the lens of the architectural and landscape 
												architectural design and planning disciplines. The program 
												focuses on growing students&rsquo; understanding of the historical, 
												cultural, and social significance of the built and natural 
												environments through site visits, seminars and travel 
												opportunities. Additionally students enjoy social opportunities, 
												the chance to interact with faculty, staff and upper-class 
												students, and involvement with design-related community service 
												organizations.</p>
												<p>Students of any major with an interest in the design and 
												development of our regions, cities, buildings, and public 
												spaces should consider this program.</p>

												not a program requirement. Other majors represented in the 
												program include construction management, geological sciences, 
												history, math, music, natural resources, psychology, sociology 
												and more. Most importantly, a strong candidate for the 
												Architecture Scholars Program is a student who is strongly 
												interested in the program&rsquo;s theme and desires to 
												investigate the historical, cultural and social significance 
												of the built and natural environment.

												<p>The program guides students through a process of 
												learning about the built environment, not just by being able
												to name places, dates, design styles and designers, but by 
												understanding why a site, building or city looks the way it 
												does and by interpreting the influential forces.
												</p>
												<p>
												Students gain knowledge and insight though shared courses and
												especially though exploration and travel outside of the 
												classroom. Service opportunities, local site visits and workshops
												aimed at developing specific skills provide a measure of 
												aptitude and awareness.  Finally, social activities provide 
												an outlet for informal interaction and a way to engage with 
												students across years of the program. 
												</p>
												<p>
												Architecture Scholars develop close ties with each other and 
												demonstrate academic success on many levels.

												</p>
												<p>
												Students who intend to major in architecture or landscape 
												architecture will also enroll in Architecture 1410 or 
												Landscape Architecture 1410, Intro to Design, during autumn 
												semester, while students who intend to major in city and 
												regional planning will enroll in City and Regional Planning 
												2110, Creating Innovative Cities and Regions. These courses 
												are also available to non-majors who wish to take them as

												</p>
												<p>
												A clustered Scholars section of the university&rsquo;s mandatory 
												first-year writing course will also be available to students who 
												need to complete this requirement.  Many Architecture Scholars 
												also choose to &ldquo;self-cluster&ldquo; themselves in General

												same time. 
												</p>
												<p>
												Additionally, both the Architecture Scholars weekend travel program, 
												and the Knowlton School of Architecture first-year study abroad program,

											<h1>Activities</h1>
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p>
													<strong>Service</strong>
												</p>
												<p>
												Giving back to the community is an important component of 
												being a responsible citizen. Architecture Scholars participate 
												in service activities related to improving the built and 
												natural environment. Service activities are often selected by 
												students themselves and reinforce the ideas and theme of the 
												Architecture Scholars program.
												</p>
												<p>
												<strong>Site Visits</strong>
												</p>
												<p>In addition to the more extensive travel opportunities 
												available to Architecture Scholars, the group also 
												participates in exploration of the local area. As a 
												student at Ohio State, it&rsquo;s important to get to know 
												the Columbus area and to take advantage of its many 
												resources. Early in autumn semester, the group will spend a 
												day exploring the highlights of the Columbus downtown. 
												Throughout the year, additional local trips and site visits 
												to buildings, parks and firms in different areas of the city 
												will be offered to students.</p>

												<p>
												<strong>Skills Development</strong>
												</p>
												<p>Aside from required courses, Architecture Scholars will 
												also have opportunities to advance their skills and talents 
												though specialized workshops outside of the typical classroom 
												environment. Whether it be architectural sketching, tips on 
												model building and what to expect in a studio class, or 
												helpful hints about AutoCad and Photoshop, the program 
												offers a way to be a step ahead and to learn skills and 
												software in advance of when many other students might first
												be introduced to these items. Many workshops are initiated 
												and taught by upper-class students.</p>

												<p>
												<strong>Social</strong>
												</p>
												<p>Architecture, landscape architecture and city and regional 
												planning are especially collaborative disciplines. To support 
												the need for working together, social activities allow 
												students to have fun and get to know each other in a casual 
												manner. Not only will you get to know the other Architecture 
												Scholars students in your class year, you’ll also get to know 
												upper-class students and faculty and staff. The strong support 
												network created by Architecture Scholars is reinforced though 
												social engagement.</p>
												<p>
												Examples of recent social activities include a pumpkin carving 
												contest, a canoe/kayak trip and a scavenger hunt. While some 
												activities are just for fun, other activities include an 
												educational component as well, such as &ldquo;Cupakes for 
												Corb&rdquo; in honor of famous architect Le Corbusier&lsquo;s 
												birthday or a similar event to celebrate the father of landscape 
												architecture, Frederick Law Olmsted.

											<h1>Travel</h1>	
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p><strong>Day Trips</strong></p>
												<p>One or more full day trips occur each year for 
												Architecture Scholars. These trips focus on exploring a 
												specific work or works of architecture or landscape 
												architecture within a short driving distance of Columbus.</p> 
												<p> Recent day trips have included visits to Frank Lloyd 
												Wright&rsquo;s Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob in western 
												Pennsylvania, the Contemporary Arts Center designed by Zaha 
												Hadid in downtown Cincinnati, and Allegheny Riverfront Park 
												by Michael Van Valkenburgh and the Carnegie Museum of Art 
												in Pittsburgh. Depending on the trip and associated costs, 
												students may be asked to contribute a small fee.</p>
												<p><strong>Weekend Travel Program</strong></p>	
												<p>Annually, Architecture Scholars have the opportunity to 
												participate in a weekend trip to study a particular city or 
												region in person. This travel opportunity is tied to a 
												required seminar in which students will learn about the 
												historical, cultural and social aspects that influenced and 
												continue to impact the design and development of the city. 
												The seminar course is typically two credits and results in 
												the creation of a student-designed travel guide to match the 
												trip itinerary. The trip itself enables students to experience 
												a new environment and to practice “reading” the city.</p> 
												<p>
												Recent destinations for the weekend travel program have 
												included Chicago, Boston, Toronto and Buffalo. The program 
												typically includes transportation, lodging, all group activities 
												and admissions costs as well as several group meals. A fee is 
												required for participation; the average cost per student is 
												typically $225-275 depending on the destination.</p>

												<p> <strong>Study Abroad</strong></p>
												<p>In addition to Honors &amp; Scholars study abroad 
												opportunities, the 
												<a target="_blank" href="http://knowlton.osu.edu/">
													Knowlton School of Architecture</a> encourages students to 
												study abroad in their first-year through the offering of its 
												own first-year program. This particular program is targeted 
												toward students who intend to major in architecture, 
												landscape architecture or city and regional planning or have 
												a strong interest in one of those disciplines. The abroad 
												program and its corresponding seminar offer an in-depth 
												experience just right for beginning students.</p>
												<p>
												London, Barcelona, and Istanbul have each served as past 
												destinations for this short-term study abroad program. A 
												program fee is required for participation.</p>

												<p>Like all of the Scholars Programs, Architecture Scholars 
												will enhance your personal experience at Ohio State by 
												providing specialized opportunities related to your specific 
												interest. Participants will be surrounded by other students 
												who share those interests and similar academic capabilities. 
												The program will provide opportunities for close interaction 
												with faculty and staff and will enable you to build a network 
												of peers and mentors that you can draw upon for advice and support. 
												</p>
												<p>
												Of course, students who participate most actively in the 
												program reap the greatest benefits. In order to maintain 
												affiliation with Architecture Scholars, students should be prepared 
												to earn at least a 3.0 GPA and meet general participation 
												requirements.
												</p>
												<p>
												<strong>Primary Benefits</strong>
												</p>
												<p>Scholars students have the following advantages: </p>
												<ul>
													<li>Shared living environment in Baker Hall West</li>
													<li>Clustered courses and recitations specifically for 
													Architecture Scholars students</li>
													<li>Travel and exploration activities right away in your 
													first year</li>
													<li>Opportunities to connect with upper-class students,

												</ul>
												<p>
												<strong>Preparation for Architecture and Landscape Architecture Majors</strong>
												</p>
												<p>The Architecture Scholars Program provides a very strong 
												preparation for the architecture and landscape architecture 
												majors. Both majors are competitive, but students who have 
												participated in Architecture Scholars during their first year
												on campus are extremely successful in being admitted to the
												major of their preference. Admission rates into these majors 
												for Architecture Scholars participants regularly exceed 90 percent.</p> 

												<p>
												For example, in June 2011, 75 percent of first-year 
												Architecture Scholars applied for admission to either the 
												architecture or landscape architecture major after completing 
												prerequisite coursework. Of those Architecture Scholars applicants, 
												96 percent were admitted to the major of their choice. The 
												average GPA of admitted Architecture Scholars students was a 
												3.53, a mark which is nearly two-tenths higher than the average 
												GPA of all admitted applicants from the overall pool. The 
												strong community and support offered by the Architecture 
												Scholars program keeps students on track.

											<h1>FAQ</h1>
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p><strong>Why should I apply to become an Architecture Scholar? </strong></p>
												<p>The Architecture Scholars Program makes a large place like Ohio State
												seem much smaller by bringing specific opportunities directly to you 
												from the very first day you arrive on campus. The camaraderie of the 
												group provides students with the incentive and motivation to achieve 
												academically. Many of the experiences and travel opportunities are only 
												available to students in the program. Together, all of the activities 
												associated with Architecture Scholars will benefit you as a student. 
												Also, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun!</p>
												<p><strong>Do I have to live in Architecture Scholars housing?</strong></p>
												<p>Yes, living in Baker West for your first year is a requirement of the
												program unless you are communing from home. Outside of the formal 
												activities and programs offered to Architecture Scholars, day-to-day 
												life in the residence hall environment is really one of the most 
												important aspects of the program. (Students that commute will have 
												access to the Architecture Scholars area in Baker West and are 
												encouraged to participate in the residential environment as fully as 
												possible.)</p>
												<p><strong>Do I have to be an architecture major to be an Architecture Scholar?</strong></p>
												<p>No, the term &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; is actually quite broad and encompasses 
												much more that most people initially think. While many students in the 
												program do initially intend to pursue architecture as major, the program
												encourages exploration of the closely related disciplines of landscape 
												architecture and city and regional planning as well as other related 
												fields. The program welcomes students of any major who have a 
												demonstrated interest in understanding the built and natural environment.
												Opinions and viewpoints of students from many backgrounds and majors 
												provide a dynamic element to the program.</p> 
												<p><strong>How much time is required to be an Architecture Scholar?</strong></p> 
												<p>Like all Scholars Programs at The Ohio State University, Architecture
												Scholars requires active participation in the program. The actual time 
												commitment can vary per week or month, but generally students are 
												expected to attend a one-hour weekly meetings as well as a handful of 
												activities and events per semester.  Some events are mandatory, while 
												others are optional. Additionally, students are encouraged to attend 
												other university events of interest to them. The time commitment is 
												very manageable. Most importantly, remember that the activities and 
												events planned for you as part of the Architecture Scholars Program 
												will help you make the most of your Ohio State education.</p> 
												
												<p><strong>How many students participate in the program?</strong></p>
												<p>The average size of each incoming Architecture Scholars cohort is 
												approximately 35 students. Formally, the program is a two-year program,
												though many students continue to be active in the program until they 
												graduate. Each year, students at any level within the program may 
												apply to join the Student Leadership Team. The Leadership Team helps 
												to determine and plan events and coordinate logistics.</p>
												<p> <strong>Will I have much contact with the Program Coordinator?</strong></p> 
												<p>Yes, the Program Coordinator holds weekly office hours in Baker West 
												and in Knowlton Hall, coordinates the weekly group meetings, and 
												participates in Scholars activities. The Program Coordinator also 
												serves as an academic advisor for architecture, landscape architecture 
												and city and regional planning majors.</p>

												<a target="_blank" href="http://architecturescholars-osu.blogspot.com">
