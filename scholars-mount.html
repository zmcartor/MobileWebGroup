											<p>The Mount Leadership Society is named in honor of the late 
											Ruth Weimer Mount. Ruth joined Ohio State as the Assistant Dean of Women in 
											1953. Later after holding other numerous positions she was named the first Dean 
											of Students in 1968. During her career, Ruth also served as President of 
											National Mortar Board Inc., the Association of College Honor Societies, and the 
											National Association of Women Deans, Administrators and Counselors. 
											</p>
											<p>After stepping down as Dean, Ruth continued her work in 
											various volunteer roles for Ohio State and the community, including involvement 
											with the OSU Hospitals Service and Executive Boards, the Alumni Association, the 
											University’s Women’s Clubs, Planned Parenthood, Columbus Symphony Orchestra, and 
											Franklin County Children’s Services. Of Ruth’s life and legacy, one friend said, 
											“Ruth Weimer Mount was the consummate volunteer. All that she did was directed 
											at improving the quality of life for others, particularly young people.” Another 
											stated, “Ruth Mount was a unique mentor. Her guidance, grace, and leadership 
											will serve as an example for the rest of my life.” </p>

											</div>

											<br />
											<p>After Ruth&rsquo;s death in 1997, the university wanted to honor her extraordinary commitment to 
											leadership and service. While many options were considered, the university 
											decided it would be most fitting to create a living, learning community of 
											students to carry on her legacy of leadership and service. The Mount Leadership 
											Society is an appropriate and fitting tribute to a woman who 
											dedicated herself to The Ohio State University, public service, and student 
											development throughout her extraordinary life and career. </p>

											<p> The Mount Leadership Society was piloted with 52 students in 
											the first class of 1999. Students were selected based on their interest in 
											leadership and service. They were 
											paired with a university mentor, engaged in service projects, and enhanced their 
											leadership skills. </p>

											Week, Year of Service, a trip to Washington D.C., Mount Committees, and the Celebration Ceremony, just 
											to name a few. In addition, former students and colleagues of Ruth Weimer Mount

												Leadership is the cornerstone of the Mount Leadership Society. Mount Scholars enhance their leadership skills through regular leadership training workshops and overnight leadership retreats. Leadership Month, held in January, focuses on a series of events and activities that center on leadership at Ohio State. In addition to these events, Mount Scholars have the opportunity to discuss current event questions with former Congressman John Kasich, and travel to Washington DC to visit our nation’s capitol city.

											<p>Often regarded as the most fun part of being in the Mount Leadership Society, both first and second year Scholars attend leadership retreats.</p>
											<p>Held in the fall, the retreat for first year Scholars is a great chance for new students to learn about each other. The retreat focuses on:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Decision making skills</li>
												<li>Diversity</li>
												<li>Problem solving skills</li>
												<li>Teamwork</li>
												<li>Midnight skits!</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The second year retreat is held in the spring and asks Scholars to reflect on their accomplishments and the legacy they wish to leave behind.</p>

												<br /> ~ Finolee Sinn, Hilliard, Ohio
											</blockquote>
											<p>Mount Legacy Week is held in early May. Each Mount Scholar joins a service team focused on a social justice issue. The goal of each team is to design and implement a service project benefiting the community, incorporating the Mount Essentials, and honoring the legacy of Ruth Weimer Mount.</p>
											<p>Upper class Mount Scholars serve as advisors, guiding the first year scholars through the process. Teams present their projects and experiences at “Decision Night”. Scholars then vote on which team is most deserving of the Outstanding Mount Legacy Week Project Award.</p>
											<p>Past Projects include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Shack-a-thon, where groups of students built homeless shelters with given items</li>
												<li>Fasting for the “30-Hour Famine”, with donations benefitting World Vision</li>

												<br />~ Rachel Koepsel, Cleveland, Ohio
											</blockquote>
											<p>Second years focus on citizenship and what it means to be a good citizen.  In addition, scholars devote their year to serving their community. Scholars spend a minimum of 75 hours working with a service agency of their choosing, centered on a specific social justice issue. Scholars can also serve as Committee Chairs for the Mount Leadership Society as their Year of Service. Scholars incorporate the Mount Essentials as well as key concepts learned through a service-learning course, Ed P&amp;L 271, into their service project.</p>
											<p>Example Year of Service Projects:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Creating and hosting “Bucks for Hearts” Silent Auction, raising over $12,000</li>
												<li>Serving as a Best Buddy for a challenged younger student</li>
												<li>Coaching high school basketball</li>
												<li>Building houses with Habitat for Humanity</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In addition, the Year of Service is a great opportunity for scholars to grow as leaders and as people, to take advantage of new educational grant opportunities, and to carry on the legacy of Ruth Weimer Mount. Furthermore, the Year of Service allows second year Mount Scholars to serve as guides and role models to the class of first year Scholars.</p>

											<p>The Mount Leadership Society was constructed as a two-year program, knowing that Mount Scholars will continue to utilize their leadership skills to take on leadership positions within the university; however, “once a Mount Scholar, always a Mount Scholar.” Many upper-class Mount Scholars stay connected with the program after their graduation from Mount. Those second years who graduate from the program are considered “Post Mounts”, while “Mount Alums” are Mount Scholars who have graduated from OSU.</p>
											<p>Mount Scholars learn about diversity through leadership training sessions at retreats, classroom discussions, and intentional conversations. Mount Scholars are encouraged to take part in OSU’s Diversity Leadership Transcript Program.</p>

												“I would like to start by saying that applying to the Mount Leadership Society was one of the best choices I made coming into college. It has opened so many doors and made the transition to college not only easy, but fun as well.”
												<br /> ~ Rico Pena, Bluffton, Ohio
											</blockquote>
											<p>Mount Scholars are continuously building on the connections and relationships formed within the Mount Leadership Society. Additional programs are implemented to help first year Mount Scholars with the transition of moving to Ohio State. In the summer, Mount Scholars entering into their first year attend a specific orientation with other Mount Scholars. The Mount Leadership Society hosts an early arrival program known as Mount Launch Week, which  allows first years to move into the residence hall early to get a better understanding of what the Mount Leadership Society is all about. When classes begin, Mount Scholars are given the opportunity to take classes with fellow Mount Scholars. Because Mount relies on the participation of its Scholars, Mounties are encouraged to join one of the many committees to help plan and organize Mount events throughout the year.</p>
											<blockquote>
												"Coming from a small town, I was really nervous to attend such a big college. Mount helped everything feel much smaller, and it is the main reason why I now call Ohio State my home. I couldn't imagine being a Buckeye without the relationships and experiences I have gotten out of Mount. It sounds cheesy, but we genuinely are ‘together for good!’ "

												“The clustered English classes fall quarter and the Mount retreat helped me to engage in activities and jump right in.  I valued the diversity within my class and developed as a leader through numerous Mount meetings.”
												<br />~ Elizabeth Shoup, Orrville, Ohio 
											</blockquote>
											<p>Mount Scholars have the opportunity to take classes with other Mount Scholars throughout their two years. These classes include, but are not limited to: </p>
											<ul>
												<li>English 110 (First-Year English Composition), required</li>
												<li><a target="blank" href="http://www.coe.ohio-state.edu/edpl/sli/271summary.html">Education Policy &amp; Leadership 271</a> (Leadership in Service), required</li>
												<li>Comparative Studies 367 (2nd level writing course) </li>
											</ul>
											<p>Some quarters, other clustered classes are arranged.</p>
											<p>Clustered classes allow Mount Scholars to be in the same classroom with other Mount Scholars. Having another scholar, sometimes your roommate, to lean on for help is certainly a "perk" of the Mount Leadership Society!</p>

								<h1>Frequent Questions</h1>
								<div class="ten columns alpha">
									<h2>Why should I choose Mount over a major-focused Scholars Program?</h2>
									<p>Many current Mount Scholars have faced this dilemma when applying to the Ohio State Scholars Program.  With approximately 100 Scholars in each class, Mount will have students from varying majors.  Because of this, there will be plenty of help available when it comes to classes.  Also, if a Mount Scholar wanted to switch out of their current course of study, he/she would not have to risk leaving Mount.  Truth be told, when asked at the end of the year if they were to go through the application process again, it was overwhelming how many Mount Scholars said they would make Mount their first choice.</p>
									<h2>Does Mount take up a lot of time?</h2>
									<p>Not at all!  As a first year, Mount Scholars are only asked to be involved from around 10 to 15 hours a month.  This includes attending leadership training workshops as well as participating in the monthly service projects.  The fun doesn’t stop there, as social events are planned too!</p>
									<h2>Do you still have time for other activities while participating in Mount?</h2>
									<p>Yes. Mount encourages its students to partake in the many other organizations Ohio State has to offer.  Mount Scholars have joined organizations ranging from Block ‘O’ to Greek life to Undergraduate Student Government.  In fact, Mount Scholars are so well rounded that quite a few have gone on to win intramural championships!</p>  
									<h2>What is expected of Mount Scholars?</h2>
									<p>Mount Scholars are asked to make a commitment to service.  As a Mount Scholar, expectations are to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Participate in all Mount activities</li>
										<li>Fully contribute to Mount Legacy Week </li>
										<li>Take ED P&amp;L 271 – a Leadership in Service course, before Spring Quarter of sophomore year</li>
										<li>Uphold the five Mount Essentials</li>
										<li>Maintain good academic standing with the university</li>
										<li>Remember the two areas that the Mount Leadership Society is known for – <strong>
											<em>Leadership</em></strong> and <strong><em>Service</em></strong></li>
										<li>Make the most out of the Mount experience! </li>
									</ul>
									<h2>What social events are planned?</h2>
									<p>Aside from meetings and service projects, there are a plethora of social activities that occur.  The sand volleyball courts outside of Halloran House provide excitement on fall and spring nights.  Mount Scholars also participate in intramural sports throughout the year together.  In addition, our “Member D” committee plans ice cream socials, birthday recognition, BBQs, and our very popular Mount Formal.  But of course, with three other people in a room, and over 150 students living in Halloran, the possibilities of finding things to do are limitless.</p>
