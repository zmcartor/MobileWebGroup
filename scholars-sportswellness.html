										The Sport and Wellness Scholars (SWS) Program is specifically 
										designed to help students better understand the career 
										opportunities available in sport and wellness fields. Students 
										will be able to identify specific interests for personal 
										development and career choice. They will also become 
										knowledgeable of what the future will demand from sport and 
										wellness professional leaders by participating in this program.
										</p>
										<p>
										Exploring the universal concept of sport and wellness will 
										take the students on a journey of discovery. Out of the 
										classroom learning opportunities include behind the scene 
										views of the administration of sports and wellness events, 
										services, and facilities. Students will focus on developing 
										relationships in a supportive environment with leaders in 
										academia and in sport and wellness professions which allows 
										for a perfect blend of academic preparation and practical 
										application. Additionally, Scholars will explore the 
										positive impact and unifying spirit that sport and wellness 
										contribute to our world.
										</p>
										<p>
										Graduates of the SWS Program will be well networked with 
										sport and wellness professionals that include alumni of The 
										Ohio State University and others who will provide them with 
										a strong foundation for their career development.

									<h1>Our Community</h1>
									<div class="ten columns alpha">
										<p>
										Sport and Wellness Scholars become a vibrant part of a 
										tremendously supportive living-learning community by residing 
										in Morrill Tower located conveniently in the shadow of three 
										of the most impressive sport and wellness sites on any 
										campus &ndash; namely, the state of the art Recreation and 
										Physical Activity Center (RPAC), the historic Ohio Stadium 
										and the Schottenstein Center.
										</p>
										<p>
										This living-learning community is not limited to the Ohio 
										State campus. Columbus and Central Ohio have extensive 
										opportunities for exploration and involvement. Whether your 
										interests lie in professional sports teams (soccer, baseball,
										and ice hockey); high school athletics; events (Special 
										Olympics, Ohio Wheelchair games and the Columbus Marathon); 
										facilities (Nationwide Arena); sports equipment businesses; 
										wellness centers; health clinics; or architectural firms, you
										will be able to explore and develop those interests through 
										involvement in SWS.
										</p>
										<p>
										Sport and Wellness Scholars participate in weekly meetings 
										and have the opportunity to tour sport and wellness sites 
										locally, nationally and internationally.  Scholars regularly 
										perform community service projects and attend social events 
										together. Every aspect of the SWS Program is designed to 
										support the development of future leaders in the sport and 
										wellness arena.

										<p>Students in the Sport and Wellness Scholars Program will 
										have a variety of classes in public health/wellness, sports, 
										marketing, and business areas to choose from as they arrange 
										their schedules each quarter. In addition, they are expected 
										to take Public Affairs 290 for two key reasons. One, this 
										course focuses on the Sport and Wellness program values of 
										leadership, service learning, professional development, 
										diversity, and gaining a global perspective. Second, the 
										course is designed to enable scholars to consider and reflect
										upon different perspectives, create new relationships across 
										campus and in the community, and collaborate with and learn 
										from your fellow Sport and Wellness Scholars. This course 
										will not only benefit our scholar community, but it will also
										be a great way for you to get to know the Coordinator of the 
										SWS Program who also co-teaches the course. Public Affairs 
										290 embodies many of the shared goals of our program, and 
										ultimately it will create a true sense of community within 
										our program.
