												</p>
												<p>Clustered courses are taught by faculty in the School of Environment and

											<h1>Trips</h1>
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p>
													While the ENR Scholars Program places a strong emphasis on environmental 
													awareness, academics and educational opportunities, the only way to appreciate 
													the natural environment is to get outside and experience it! Therefore, ENR 
													Scholars trips and retreats balance the fun and excitement of outdoor travel 
													with a strong educational component. Students participate in fun outdoor 
													experiences that can include learning outdoor skills and developing their 
													environmental knowledge in a field setting.</p>
												<p>
													In the first year, students go on a fall camping retreat in the Hocking Hills 
													and are given a number of other opportunities to experience the outdoors - 
													winter hikes, outdoor service projects, or a trip to Stone Lab at Lake Erie are 
													just a few examples! In the second year, more educational and recreational trips 
													are available, such as a visit to a wind farm and a canoeing trip.</p>

											<h1>Study Abroad</h1>
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p>
													There are few adventures in life that can compare with the excitement of a trip 
													to an international destination. In addition, many current environmental issues 
													are occurring in remote areas outside of the U.S. and have vast, global 
													implications. Because of these factors, ENR Scholars are invited to apply for a 
													short-term study abroad program offered by the School of Environment and Natural 
													Resources in Iceland!</p>
												<p>
													In this program, students learn about a strikingly beautiful country that has 
													unique and diverse environmental advantages as well as problems to be solved. 
													Participants also study and experience the culture and history of Iceland and 
													take part in outdoor activities such as hiking and horseback riding.</p>
												<p>
													By participating, ENR Scholars receive graded credit hours that can be applied 
													towards GEC, major or minor requirements or electives depending on their 
													specific major. In addition, university scholarships and fundraising 
													opportunities are available to help offset travel costs, including a scholarship 
													offered exclusively to ENR Scholars. Although the program is optional, all ENR 
													Scholars are encouraged to apply!</p>

									<h1>Participation and Involvement</h1>
									<div class="ten columns alpha">
										<p>
											First year students have 
											many great programs to participate in, and are expected to attend all mandatory 
											events which include meetings and the fall camping retreat. Other events, trips, 
											and programs are available for them to choose from and include lectures and 
											guest speakers, service projects and outdoor adventure type programs, such as 
											canoeing trips and hikes. If interested, students may also participate in 
											recruiting efforts and the ENR Leadership Council, which is responsible for 
											planning some of the group’s events and activities.</p><p>
											Second year ENR Scholars are expected to continue their participation in a 
											number of ENR Scholars events throughout the year, some of which may be planned 
											specifically for them. The majority of the students serving on the Leadership 
											Council are second year Scholars. They also have the opportunity to help recruit 
											for the program and to represent ENR Scholars and the Honors &amp; Scholars Program 
											as a Scholars Ambassador. Second year students may also request to return to 
											Blackburn House, in order to remain a part of the ENR Scholars learning 
											community in the residence hall.
											</p>
										<p>
											While the ENR Scholars Program is a two-year program, third and fourth year 
											students are encouraged to remain involved. Routes for their continued 
											involvement include participating in regular ENR Scholars meetings and events, 
											serving as mentors for incoming ENR Scholars, and assisting in the recruitment 
											and selection of incoming students.

									<h1>FAQ</h1>
									<div class="ten columns alpha">
										<p>
											<b>Do I have to be an Environment and Natural Resource major to be a part of the 
											program?</b></p>
										<p>
											No - we welcome students from all majors and interest areas to be involved! The 
											only requirement is that students have an interest in learning more about the 
											environment and enjoy the outdoors. Students’ backgrounds can range from those 
											who simply love to hike and camp to those who want to be scientists, outdoor 
											educators, and administrators.</p>
										<p>
											<b>How many students participate in the program?</b></p>
										<p>
											The average size of each incoming ENR Scholars cohort is approximately 40-50 
											students. This is an ideal size as it enables students to get to know each other 
											quickly and participate in a variety of workshops and programs.</p>
										<p>
											<b>Where do ENR Scholars live?</b></p>
										<p>
											ENR Scholars live as a community in Blackburn House, a north campus residence 
											hall. Students are required to live together as freshmen on one of two floors 
											and may be roommates with other ENR Scholars. North campus residence halls house 
											students in four person suites that have private bathrooms, air conditioning, a 
											study room, and a bedroom. For more housing information, visit
											<u><a href="http://housing.osu.edu/" target=_blank>
											http://housing.osu.edu</a></u>.</p>
										<p>
											<b>Are ENR Scholars required to take all of the clustered courses?</b></p>
										<p>
											In order to fully understand the nature and scope of environmental problems, ENR 
											Scholars take all clustered courses in the freshmen year. If a student has an 
											unavoidable conflict with another required course, arrangements can be made on 
											an individual basis. All clustered courses fulfill GEC requirements for 
											non-Environment and Natural Resources majors, depending on major. Also, by 
											enrolling in the clustered courses, a Natural Resources Management minor is 
											easily obtainable by taking a few additional courses (such as the Iceland study 
											abroad program!).</p>
										<p>
											<b>In what types of outdoor activities do ENR Scholars participate?</b></p>
										<p>
											ENR Scholars participate in a variety of outdoor activities, including many 
											suggested by the group. Trips can be educational, such as the Bowling Green Wind 
											Farm, or recreational, such as camping, canoeing and hiking, just to name a few!</p>
										<p>
											<b>What are some additional benefits associated with being an ENR Scholar?</b></p>
										<p>
											Students participating in the ENR Scholars program have many unique 
											opportunities! For example, students will meet prominent faculty members such as 
											Dr. Lonnie Thompson, and speakers from around the world, such as Dr. Wangari 
											Maathai, environmentalist and Nobel Peace Prize Winner. Research presentations 
											and round-table discussions, tours of campus research facilities, travel and 
											environmentally-base community service projects are all examples of special 
											opportunities for our ENR Scholars.</p>
										<p>
											<b>How much time is required to be an ENR Scholar?</b></p>
										<p>
											Like all Scholars Programs at The Ohio State University, ENR Scholars requires 
											approximately 10-15 hours of time each month. This time is distributed between 
											meetings, events, speakers, trips, and classes. Students are able to be more 
											involved as their academic work and social schedules permit; however, all 
											students must participate in the mandatory programs and events.</p>
										<p>
											<b>This sounds great! How do I become a member of ENR Scholars?</b></p>
										<p>
											Like all Scholars Programs, the ENR Scholars Program is selective. Students must 
											apply to be admitted. The application can be accessed through The Ohio State 
											University Honors and Scholars website. Best of Luck!</p>
