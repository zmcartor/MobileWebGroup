											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p>The Arts Scholars Program enables select students with a strong 
												interest in the disciplines of art, music, theatre, dance, design, 
												fashion, culinary arts, and more to collaborate and grow together through
												a close-knit arts family.  Students in the Arts Scholars program may 
												have a major in any university college or department. The program offers
												students the opportunity to participate in programs that enhance their 
												educational experience. These programs include lectures and specialized 
												workshops, group excursions to museums and professional performances, a 
												juried student art exhibition and performance showcase, 
												community involvement, and domestic and international trips.</p>

												<p>The Arts Scholars family consists of approximately 75 first year students and 200 upper-level students who commit to completing minimal expectations across 
												their four year undergraduate career at The Ohio State University.  50% of the students in the program are majoring in the arts such as Art, Art Education, 
												Art &amp; Technology, Visual Communication Design, Music Performance, Music Education, Dance, Theatre, and History of Art.  The other 50% are majoring in 
												disciplines across the university such as Engineering, English, Biology, Food Science, Business, Spanish, and Psychology.  Finding a pre-med ballerina, a 
												guitar-jamming engineer, or a fine artist business student is easy amongst our community.</p>

												<p>Values of the Arts Scholars Program:</p>
												<p>
												<strong>Interdisciplinary Arts:</strong> respect and learn about all arts disciplines<br />
												<strong>Family:</strong> bond with and support one another through your college career<br/>
												<strong>Diversity:</strong> appreciate other perspectives, backgrounds, and identities<br />
												<strong>Service:</strong> support the arts through time, talent, and treasure<br />
												<strong>Art for Life:</strong> keep connected with the arts through a career or civic involvement

											<h1>Components</h1>
											<div class="ten columns alpha">
												<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>
												<p>Students are invited to attend events and activities each quarter 
												including career workshops, performances, art workshops, academic 
												speakers, movie nights, networking opportunities, mentor events, and 
												much more.  Programming is meant to both educate students about arts 
												disciplines but also build community amongst students in the program.
												Students also have the chance to network and meet faculty and arts 
												leaders early on in their college career through various programming.</p>

												<p><strong>Service</strong></p>
												<p>
												Students are expected to participate in minimal service as an Arts 
												Scholar which can include service within the arts community.  Student 
												leadership and the staff plan service opportunities throughout the year.
												</p>

												<p><strong>Family Meetings</strong></p>

												<p>
												The Arts Scholars Family (consisting of staff members, students, and 
												sometimes speakers and guests) meets bi-weekly throughout the year in 
												the Baker Hall West Performance Space.  These meetings are used to 
												give announcements, sign-up for events, introduce speakers from around 
												campus and in the community, and allow for networking amongst students 
												in the program.  
												</p>

												<p><strong>Mentor Program</strong></p>
												<p>
												To encourage a strong cohesive community that crosses years, incoming 
												students are matched to an upperclassman student who has been trained 
												in serving as a resource and mentor to new Ohio State students.  
												Students are encouraged to attend events and meetings together through 
												the mentor program.  Upperclassmen are referred to as BIGs and incoming
												students are littles.  Students are matched based upon both academic 
												and personal interests.
												</p>

												<p><strong>Arts Leaders Council</strong></p>
												<p>
												A council of 10 current students serves as both an advisory board to 
												the program staff and as a programming board to manage events.  Students
												on the council learn		leadership skills such as communication, 
												event management, organization, personality differences, diversity, 
												and time management.  First year students are allowed to apply for the 
												Arts Leaders Council during their first quarter.
												</p>

												<p><strong>Trips</strong></p>

												<p>
												In addition to an annual New York City Trip, the Arts Scholars also 
												travel to another city for the day during the autumn quarter and for 
												another overnight trip in spring quarter.  Past trips have included day
												trips to Cleveland and Pittsburgh and overnight trips to Louisville, 
												Washington, DC, Chicago, and Toronto.  These travel experiences are 
												meant to introduce students to the arts in other cities and educate 
												them about career opportunities.

												First-year Arts Scholars who are not commuting are required to live in 
												Baker Hall West, the Visual and Performing Arts residence hall. The 
												advantage to having Arts Scholars live in the same building is that 
												you will have the opportunity to benefit from relationships with other 
												students who share your same interests. You will also benefit from the 
												resources contained within Baker West, such as a large performance 
												space, dance room, music practice rooms, and an art and design room.
												</p>

												<p>A unique aspect of the Arts Scholars Program is the large number of 
												upperclassman Scholars living in the same residence hall as the first 
												year students. You have	the benefit of networking with upperclassmen 
												Arts Scholars at any time because over 40 return to Baker Hall West

												<p>
												First year students enroll in the Arts Scholars Seminar Class during their first semester at Ohio State as a way to build community within the program and introduce students to the arts communities of Ohio State and Columbus. 
												Students enjoy speakers and guests from on and off campus in addition to a few assignments aimed at getting students involved in the arts community such as navigating the Short North (Columbus's premier arts district, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shortnorth.org">http://www.shortnorth.org</a>). 
												During the semester, this class is held once a week for 48-minutes and taught by the Program Manager and Graduate Administrative Associate. It meets in the Baker West Hall Performance Space, which is convenient for students and promotes 
												the family community. During a class in autumn 2010, the conductor of the Columbus Symphony Chorus, Ron Jenkins, spoke with the class about the upcoming performance of Handel's Messiah at the Ohio Theatre. A group of students then were able to 
												attend the performance to see the maestro at work.

												exhibition, students learn about pricing, installation, and other skills 
												involved in displaying their artwork in public sometimes for the first 
												time.  This exhibition is open to all majors and has featured arts and 
												non-arts majors in the past.  Arts Scholars are responsible for all 
												aspects of the exhibition, including:
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Determining the theme and timeline through a student committee</li>

													<li>Submitting their own unique artwork for consideration</li>
													<li>Engaging in gallery installation workshops</li>

												guitar, flute trio, and group dance. Different from a quarterly

												Students also meet with successful OSU alumni to learn more about career 
												planning for moving to larger cities after graduation. During the 2011 
												trip, students took a dance class with a professional Broadway 
												choreographer, toured the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and met a

												<p>
												Students in the Arts Scholars Program have had the opportunity to participate in a short-term study abroad program in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Merida, 
												Mexico. 
												</p>

												<p>
												Rio de Janeiro is considered one of the most beautiful and spectacular cities in Brazil. While in Rio, students were given the opportunity to work on an				 
												interdisciplinary team project with Brazilian students from the State University of Rio de Janeiro's Escola Superior de Desenho Industrial (ESDI). 
												Students experience the sites of Sugar Loaf Mountain, the world famous beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema, the statue of Christ the Redeemer, and Corcovado
												Mountain. Cultural visits to Rio's famous museums and theatres, including the Teatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro and the Museu Casa do Pontal are also 
												included. The diverse dance and musical culture of 
												Brazil is also explored while attending spectacular capoiera, bosa nova, and samba performances. 
												</p>

												<p>
												In Merida, located in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, students participated in a nationally-covered art exhibition in the famous Modern Art Museum, Museo
												Macay.  The group also visited ancient Mayan sites including Chichen Itza on the Spring Equinox, Uxmal, and the environmental educational site at Kiuic. 
												Students participated in a day-long Mayan handmade paper workshop revived by American-Mexican artist Mark Callaghan. 
												</p>

												<p>The study abroad portion of the program is preceded in winter quarter by a specially designed general education class. During the preparatory class, students investigate different modes of communication across disciplines and cultures, as well as the interwoven experience of art and culture in our everyday lives. Arts Scholars continually investigate the questions of surroundings and background as a text for travel and self-discovery.</p>

									<h1>FAQ</h1>	
									<div class="ten columns alpha">
										<p><strong>How competitive is the application process?</strong></p>
										<p>
										Through the application process, the Program Manager looks for students who have been involved in the arts while in high school and are strongly interested in 
										maintaining that connection.  Each first year cohort consists of 75-100 students.  While all of the Scholars Programs are competitive, prospective students who 
										are interested in this community should apply regardless of their test scores and class rank.  Students who are academically driven and have a proven interest in 
										the arts will be strong applicants to the Arts Scholars Program.
										</p>

										<p><strong>Do I have to major in the arts to be an Arts Scholar?</strong>
										<p>
										No.  All of the Ohio State Scholars Programs are open to any major and the Arts Scholars Program values diversity of majors and experiences to enhance the arts 
										family.  While majoring in the arts is not required, students who best fit in the family are those who were active in some form of the arts while in high school.
										</p>

										<p><strong>Do I have to live in a particular residence hall?</strong></p>
										<p>
										Yes, unless commuting to campus as a first year student.  Students in the Arts Scholars Program live in Baker Hall West on south campus alongside the Visual and 
										Performing Arts Learning Community.  Under the philosophy of "Baker Love," this building is a supportive environment for arts majors and non-arts majors alike and
										has one of the highest return rates for upperclassmen living in the building.  Commuters receive access to Baker Hall West and are invited to all events.
