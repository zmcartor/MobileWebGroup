										<hr />
										<h4>What is the difference between the Honors Program and the Scholars Program?</h4>
       										<p>The University Honors Program and the Ohio State Scholars Program are specialized programs for high ability students interested in joining academically stimulating, close-knit communities within the larger Ohio State community. Both programs are open to students in any of Ohio State’s 170+ majors. The basic difference between the two programs is that Honors is a curricular program (i.e., the focus is on activities occurring in the classroom) and Scholars is a co-curricular program (i.e., the focus is on activities occurring outside of the classroom).</p>
										<hr />
        								<h4>Can I be in both the Honors Program and the Scholars Program?</h4>
        									<p>You cannot initially enroll in both programs as an incoming freshman. As an incoming first year student, you submit an application for admission that allows you to be considered for the Honors Program and all 14 Scholars Programs.    Please note that you can only join the Scholars Program as an incoming freshman.  However, the Honors Program accepts transfer students as well as currently enrolled Ohio State students. Therefore, Scholars students who meet Honors Program criteria after being on campus for at least 1 semester may apply to the Honors Program directly through their college of enrollment.</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>How much does it cost to go to Ohio State and are there extra fees to be in the Honors Program or the Scholars Programs?</h4>
											<p>There are no additional fees associated with being in the Honors Program or any of the Scholars Programs. Please visit <a href="http://undergrad.osu.edu/costs.html" target="_blank">http://undergrad.osu.edu/costs.html</a> to learn more about the cost of attending Ohio State. </p>
										<hr />
										<h4>How do I apply to the Honors Program?</h4>
									        <p>Please <a href="http://hsapp.osu.edu" target="_blank">click here</a> to submit your online application to the University Honors Program and the Ohio State Scholars Program.</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>When is the application deadline?</h4>
									        <p>The priority deadline to submit your application is December 15th. The final submission deadline is February 15th.</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>Why doesn’t the online application ask for my test scores, class rank or GPA?</h4>
											<p>The online application does not ask for test scores, class rank, or GPA because we access that information from your official high school transcript and test scores that you submit to the university when you apply for admission.</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>Is there a minimum test score or class rank/GPA to apply?</h4>
											<p>There is no minimum set of requirements to be considered for the Honors Program. All interested students are encouraged to apply. Please note that your application will not advance in the review process until you are admitted to the Columbus campus (regional campus applicants can also apply to the Honors Program by following the “click here” link above).</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>How will I know if you have received my application?</h4>
											<p>Once we receive your application, we will acknowledge receipt via email to the address that you provide in your application. You can always contact our office if you want to make sure that we have your application. You can <a href="mailto:honors-scholars@osu.edu">email</a> us or you can call us at 614.292.3135. The Center’s hours during the academic year are as follows: <br/><br/>
											•	Monday through Thursday: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.<br/>
											•	Friday: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br/></p>
										<hr />
										<h4>When will I know whether I’ve been accepted to one of the programs?</h4>
											<p>Students who meet the December 15th priority application deadline will receive their decision in late January. Students who apply after December 15th but by the February 15th final deadline will receive their decision in late March.</p>
										<hr />
										<h4>What are the requirements to stay in the Honors Program?</h4>
											<p>In order to remain in good standing in the Honors Program you must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.4 (3.5 for some majors) and complete six Honors courses (or equivalent courses) in your first 2 years at Ohio State.  In addition, to graduate “with Honors” or “with Honors Research Distinction” you must fulfill all additional requirements stipulated by your college of enrollment (i.e., additional Honors coursework; senior Honors thesis, internship or study abroad experiences, etc.).</p>		
										<hr />
										<h4>How do transfer students get into the Honors Program? </h4>
											<p>Students transferring from other institutions should consult their intended college of enrollment for Honors admission information. Click <a href="http://honors-scholars.osu.edu/honors/academics.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>        
										<hr />
										<h4>Do I have to live in an Honors residence hall if I am admitted to the Honors Program? </h4>
											<p>No, you do not have to live in an Honors residence hall if you are admitted to the program. However, the majority of our incoming Honors freshmen choose to live in an Honors residence hall. </p> 
										<hr />
										<h4>Can I be guaranteed a space in an Honors residence hall? </h4>
											<p>No, housing assignments are made based upon the date when students submit their residence hall contracts online. Depending upon demand for Honors housing, it is possible for it to reach capacity.</p> 
										<hr />
										<h4>When will I get information about campus housing, selecting my residence hall, and learning who my roommate is?</h4>
											<p>Housing contracts are sent via email from the Housing Office based upon when students pay their $100 acceptance fee to Ohio State. Students may receive housing contracts as early as March. The contract asks students to indicate the area of campus in which they would prefer to live. Students can also preference a space in an Honors residence hall or note their interest in living with someone that they already know. Actual housing assignments that specify residence hall, room number, and roommate(s) are sent to students’ Ohio State email address in July.</p> 
										<hr />
										<h4>When will I receive information about orientation?</h4>
											<p>Orientation information is mailed to students from the Orientation Office based upon when students pay their $100 acceptance fee to Ohio State. Students begin receiving information packets in early spring that will allow them to schedule orientation dates.</p> 
										<hr />
										<h4>Who do I call if I want information about . . .  </h4>

										<p>The majority of <a href="http://meritawards.osu.edu" target="_blank">merit-based scholarships</a> are awarded by Ohio State's Office of 
										Undergraduate Admissions &amp; First Year Experience.  These scholarships are awarded on the basis of ACT/SAT scores and class rank.  They are not 
										associated with being admitted to the Honors &amp; Scholars Programs.  To be considered for Ohio State's merit-based scholarships, students must submit 
										their <a href="http://apply.osu.edu" target="_blank">freshman admission application</a> to Undergraduate Admissions by December 1.</p>                 
										<p>To be considered for need-based aid, students must submit their <a href="http://www.fafsa.gov" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal

										<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Select students admitted to the Honors Program at the Columbus Campus of Ohio State will be invited to compete for 
										four scholarships awarded by the University Honors &amp; Scholars Center.  The four scholarships and the approximate number awarded are as follows:  
										Battelle Scholarship (4 awarded), Glenna R. Joyce Scholarship (3 awarded), Medalist Scholarship (50 awarded), and Presidential Scholarship (15 
										awarded).  To be considered for these scholarships, students must submit their <a href="http://hsapp.osu.edu" target="_blank">H&amp;S Application</a> by 
										December 15th and be admitted to the Honors Program. Approximately 100 selected competitors are contacted by the Center in mid-March with additional
